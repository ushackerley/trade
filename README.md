# trade

The aim of this project is to create a space in which we can explore datasets using intuitive modules to navigate the most obvious questions. Each dataset will have a set of modules associated for easier navigation through the data.

At the moment, I have data from the OEC API using an OEC Python Wrapper, as well as data from the FAO.

To run this, navigate to folder and do:

```python3 -i trade_script.py```
